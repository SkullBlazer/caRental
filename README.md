# caRental

This is a project created for my course.
It's a website to rent cars for any amount of time. To book a car, you have to login or register then login.
After that, you have to specify a destination, rent date and time, and return date and time.
Then, you can pick a car of your choice from the variety of options provided.
Finally, it will calculate the approximate fees to be paid, not including damages and late return fees etc. and you can either proceed (which will prompt you to give your credit card details to automatically deduct from your bank account) or cancel and book another car or destination and times.
