        Transport facility is a matter of headache for those people who do not have any personal transport in India. On occasions like Weddings, Vacation, house shifting, and tour outside India and on many other situations they feel the necessity of a vehicle to sort out the problems. <br> So, if it is possible to design or develop a web-based application for availing transport whenever and wherever possible, then it will be beneficial for both renter and transport provider. Now a days, by some clicks only, we can get whatever you want at home. We already know about the online shopping, e-banking etc. Similarly, the Car Rental System is the online facility to book cars online within few clicks only. Some people cannot afford to have a car, for those people this system becomes very helpful. This system includes various cars, as per the customer order and comfort, it place the order and deliver the car as per the location within the area. For travelling a long distance, booking can be done via internet service only.
        <br>Ca-R-ental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period. Getting a rental car helps people get around despite the fact they do not have access to their own personal vehicle or don't own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car must contact a rental car company and contract out for a vehicle. This system increases customer retention and simplify vehicle and staff management.
